Channels
========

Channels are the medium through which messages are sent.
A channel is defined as a dataclass, where the dataclass fields define the accepted
notification payload. A channel must subclass one of the ``pgpubsub.channel.Channel`` or
``pgpubsub.channel.TriggerChannel`` classes, where the latter should be used when a
postgres-trigger is used as the notifying event and the former when it is not.
Channels must be declared in your app's ``channels.py`` file.


The ``Channel`` class
---------------------

For our first example, the data required to update the aforementioned post-reads-per-day cache
is a date and a ``Post`` id. This payload defines the fields of our first channel dataclass,
through which notifications will be sent to update the post-reads-per-day cache. Since we
do not use a trigger here, our channel should inherit from ``pgpubsub.channel.Channel``:


.. code-block:: python

    # channels.py
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    import datetime

    from pgpubsub.channel import Channel


    @dataclass
    class PostReads(Channel):
        model_id: int
        date: datetime.date


Note the accepted dataclass field types for classes inheriting from
``Channel`` are iterables (lists, tuples, dicts, sets) of:

* python primitive types
* (naive) ``datetime.date`` objects


The ``TriggerChannel`` class
----------------------------

In our second example we wish to have a channel through which
notifications sent whenever a postgres-trigger is invoked by the creation
of an ``Author`` object. To achieve this, we define our channel like so (
also in our apps ``channels.py`` module):

.. code-block:: python

    from dataclasses import dataclass

    from pgpubsub.channel import TriggerChannel
    from pgpubsub.tests.models import Author


    @dataclass
    class AuthorTriggerChannel(TriggerChannel):
        model = Author


Note that the key difference between this and the previous example is that
this channel inherits from ``TriggerChannel``, which defines the payload for
all trigger-based notifications:

.. code-block:: python

    @dataclass
    class TriggerChannel(_Channel):
        model = NotImplementedError
        old: django.db.models.Model
        new: django.db.models.Model


Here the ``old`` and ``new`` parameters are the (unsaved) versions of what the
trigger invoking instance looked like before and after the trigger was invoked.
These objects are built by passing in the trigger notification payload through
Django's model `deserializers <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/serialization/>`__.

In this example, ``old`` would refer to the state of our ``Author`` object
pre-creation (and would hence be ``None``) and ``new`` would refer to a copy of
the newly created ``Author`` instance. This payload is inspired by the ``OLD``
and ``NEW`` values available in the postgres ``CREATE TRIGGER`` statement
(https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/sql-createtrigger.html). The only custom
logic we need to define on a trigger channel is the ``model`` class-level
attribute.
